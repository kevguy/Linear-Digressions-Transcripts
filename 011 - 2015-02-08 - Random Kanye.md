| Ben: | On this episode of Linear Digression. Who is Kanye West? Is he a machine? Find out. Okay actually, so to be quite honest, to be quite honest, I don't really know anything about Kanye West, other than he produces music in his head, he's a rapper and I don't feel comfortable pronouncing a lot of the titles of his songs. |
| Katie: | I don’t know anything about him either. I’ll be honest, Ben. |
| Ben: | You don't? |
| Katie: | Well, I listened to like three Kanye West songs in my life. But what I do know something about is Markov chain, as it turns out you don't need to understand Kanye West if you understand Markov Chains, so that's all about today. |
| Ben: | Right, so can you tell me what Markov chains are? Like I want to know how markov chains relate to Kanye West but first I need to know know what they are. |
| Katie: | Yes, so a Markov chain is basically a way of simulating, em, what can happen in a given situation, so let me ... |
| Ben: | Make a choice. |
| Katie: | Sort of, yeah. So, let me give you an example from gambling |. So let’s see you're playing like a slot machine right, and you're sitting here and here, and you're... you're flipping a coin, maybe something like this, and you're just pulling in, and each time there's a number of different outcomes that can happen and each of them has a probability that’s associated with it. |
| Ben: | So 50% heads 50% tails. |
| Katie: | Exactly. And the thing that makes it... and so you sit there and you were to flip a coin 10 times and you would come up with a sequence of 10 heads or tails and that... sort of all of those put together is a markov chain. And the thing that is very special about Markov was really good for like running simulations, especially making like fake data for yourself to like sort of learn from when you're doing machine learning. One of the things that makes them very powerful is that each step is independent of the one that came before. |
| Ben: | So your coin isn't going to say, alright, I did heads 3 times so I should be tails now. |
| Katie: | Bingo. |
| Ben: | It’s cheap to to do computationally. Right ? |
| Katie: | Exactly, that’s the point. |
| Ben: | You don't have to think like ‘alright, what did I do before, what should I do now’. You can just say ‘I don't care what I did before, I'm just going to do this now or that now’. |
| Katie: | Yeah, with a certain probability. And so then you string all these things together and it still looks like a completely, you know, normal sequence of heads and tails but it’s computationally very fast so just do that like over and over again, and you come up with a really tight simulation of whatever it is you're trying to simulate. |
| Ben: | Mm hmm. |
| Katie: | So one example of a way that you can do a markov chain is you can run a markov chain not with flipping heads and flipping a coin, but with coming up with sequences of words. |
| Ben: | Okay. So, instead of having a data set of a rather, instead of having a corpus that you're pulling from of heads and tails on those are the only two choices, you've got all of these words and their relationships to each other. |
| Katie: | Exactly. So, if I say the word ‘Ben’, then within the corpus I know there will be a very high probability the next word that I can get is going to be ‘Jaffe’, i.e. Ben Jaffe. And with a somewhat more probability I can get the word ‘is’. |
| Ben: | ‘Is’ or ‘are’? Ben has? But you are not going to say Ben turtle. That doesn't, that probably won't exist within your data set. |
| Katie: | Right. So, for each word you come up with all the work they could follow with the probabilities attached to them and then you can sort of make your way through those words and one after the other. Each one ignores everything that's come before it but you straight start to string together these words into a semi-coherent. |
| Ben: | I think I see where you're going but so just to make sure I'm understanding correctly. So another example of a marcov chain, if I'm right, could be the route that I bike to work. So, at any point I can turn right, or I can turn go straight, or I can turn left. And let's say that work is over to the right, it's very unlikely I'm going to turn left. It's kind of like me I might go straight to go on a different road or something. I'm more likely to turn right and I'm kind of like the street by street forward to path and it doesn't matter what my previous choices were. I'm going to make a decision based on where Udacity is and where I am on the map or something like this. |
| Katie: | Exactly. |
| Ben: | So I create this path through the world through these intersections, just like we're talking about probably creating a path with words where you come to... you come to a junction and you have the word that you are on and then you have all of the different words you can go to next. |
| Katie: | Exactly. I think you just explained it better than I did. |
| Ben: | Are you, are you saying that you can take Kanye West’s lyrics and figure out what we're going next from what to what ? |
| Katie: | It’s almost as if I am saying that, aren’t I? I mean, you can use any words, right? It's just really fun with Kanye West lyrics. |
| Ben: | That’s awesome. |
| Katie: | They kind of don't make sense anyway and it's a very rich and interesting vocabulary but this is one of my favourite applications of marcov chains. |
| Ben: | Okay. So that's where Markov Chains and Kanye West connect. |
| Katie: | That's where they meet up, you know, on the other side, yeah. So anyway you can you take all the lyrics of Kanye West songs and then you generate yourself a little random Kanye. |
| Ben: | You know what we mean is we need to get Kanye West to rap some of these. That’ll be fantastic. |
| Katie: | We will probably need a higher budget for that. |
| Ben: | Oh you mean like a budget more than zero? |
| Katie: | More than zero yeah, but let’s... hey Kanye, if you're listening. |
| Ben: | yeah, we will take you out to lunch, free lunch. Okay, so I don’t even know if he listens to ... |
| Katie: | Probably not. |
| Ben: | So, what else can you do with this? I mean we've got just Kanye West, right? |
| Katie: | So, I mean you can... you can do literally anything in the course of looking around. So I first heard about this project cause one of my friends did it at like a school... like a homework assignment for one of her computer science classes. I couldn't get in touch with her for this episode unfortunately, but I was googling around and turns out lots of people have had this idea, specifically having a random Kanye West generator. And one of them that I found that I really like aren’t not just from Kanye West but from Bible verses and then merges them together, see if it is really weird Kanye West plus like Old Testament feel to the... to the stuff that you get out. |
| Ben: | That is wonderful. If so... so one of them, this is http://genesisofkanye.tumblr.com. ‘If Drake made thee one, I make thee with what’s happening in a little bit of all their families’. That sounds like nonsense to me. |
| Katie: | It kind of does. |
| Ben: | But I'll bet if I was a Kanye listener, it might make a little bit more sense or at least seem a little more familiar. |
| Katie: | Yeah, ‘It was but is real: for your back, Zara, H&M, Francois Pinault’. I assume that these can all be designers but then it's kind of merged into with something about biblical and is real. |
| Ben: | People are slaves to design a powerful impact I said onto him. |
| Katie: | It's kinda late and it's biblical. |
| Ben: | lt's really strange. That's really really strange but I kinda like it. |
| Katie: | It's fun isn’t it? |
| Ben: | I really want these in music. So if there's anyone who sounds like Kanye and has a recording budget, get in touch with us. Anyway, so to wrap up Kanye plus Markov chains. |
| Katie: | Equals random Kanye equals all the Kanye you could ever want you can have like just ... |
| Ben: | You could make ... |
| Katie: | A computer program that just always printing out Kanye West lyrics. |
| Ben: | Infinite Kanye. It sounds like an art project, a printer that's constantly putting Kanye West. |
| Katie: | I love it. Let's do this. |
