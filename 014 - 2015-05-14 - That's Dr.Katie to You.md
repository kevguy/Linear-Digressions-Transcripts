| Ben: | Katie! |
| Katie: | Ben! |
| Ben: | You’re back! |
| Katie: | That’s Dr. Katie now. |
| Ben: | Oh, Dr. Katie Malone? |
| Katie: | That’s my name. |
| Ben: | Does that mean I have to like… is it a change of interaction or anything? You have a Phd now. |
| Katie: | I… well you can’t see this if you were listening but I’m sitting here with a snifter full of Brandy in my hand. |
| Ben: | That is a lie. |
| Katie: | I’m smoking a cigar. It is a lie but I’m making the hand gestures. |
| Ben: | That’s true. You’re making and gestures. |
| Katie: | We should tell the good people what we’re talking about. So for the last six years I’ve been working I’ve been working on a Phd in Physics, and about ten days ago now, I successfully defended my thesis. There’s still some work to do but that was the last big hurdle to clear, so I’m a very happy camper right now. |
| Ben: | I was there. And also, this is the first time since the day that you did that we have spoken. |
| Katie: | That’s right, yeah. |
| Ben: | It’s been ten days of rest for you right? |
| Katie: | Yeah, it’s nice to be back though. |
| Ben: | That’s good. Also, I should also say for all of those of you who are listening who were not there to see that glorious event. It was a room full of people who knew very much what they were talking about in terms of Physics, and a bunch of people who had no idea what was going on. |
| Katie: | This is very bimodal distribution. |
| Ben: | You were talking about supersymmetry and those super crazy stuff and like words I have never heard and I didn’t even know existed. And you made a worksheet. |
| Katie: | I did. (laughs) |
| Ben: | You made a worksheet for me and like you know… for all of the non-physicists in the room. Basically like… if you hear this word, write down how’d you like… what was one of the questions? |
| Katie: | So… here we go, question no. 8. If there were a supersymmetric higgs boson that weigh 500 GeV and decay the bottom quarks, previous searches on which experiment would have been able to be detected? |
| Ben: | And so I basically sat there, waiting until I saw 500 GeV in one of your slides, and then frantically searching for the answer. And as it turned out, we all did very poorly on your worksheet. |
| Katie: | Oh…Spencer...Spencer did pretty well. Spencer was one of our friends who’s… a member in the Udacity family so to speak, but also a physicist. He did pretty well. |
| Ben: | That’s true. I kind of failed. |
| Katie: | That’s okay. |
| Ben: | I scored my worksheet really generously, and I got like six out of thirteen. And that was good. |
| Katie: | I’m gonna be honest, Ben. You were not the one who was really being tested that day. So don’t worry about it too much. |
| Ben: | That’s true. And you passed. So, if you’ve been listening to all of the episodes up until now, maybe the last four or five episodes, those were all episodes that we did not record recently. And you may have noticed maybe the room quality change there was a little echoey in one of them, and that’s because they were some of the first episodes that we’ve ever recorded. So, now we’re back. |
| Katie: | Got a bunch of good stuff coming. |
| Ben: | The next episode in the feed is an episode that we recorded a little bit while ago, and it was about your job search. So, enjoy. |
