| Ben: | Hey Katie. |
| Katie: | Hey Ben. |
| Ben: | Hey, so what are we talking about today? |
| Katie: | So I was in the Bay Area recently, it's been a little while. |
| Ben: | What? You didn’t call me. |
| Katie: | I know, I was only there for like an afternoon. |
| Ben: | Okay. |
| Katie: | Something personal. One of the things that I had forgotten about the Bay Area and I don't miss in the slightest is the traffic on the 101. Have you experienced the delight that is Rush Hour Bay Area Traffic? |
| Ben: | Oh right, I just avoid the 101. And yes, I have experienced, it's not delightful at all. |
| Katie: | Oh, it’s the worst. |
| Ben: | But yeah, the 101 is like a grown-up crowd path or something, it's so winding and random, and lanes appear and disappear. It's like... it wasn't... it doesn't feel like it was built to be a freeway. |
| Katie: | I don’t… I mean, I don't think it's particularly winding, it just doesn't move at all. But... |
| Ben: | Well... |
| Katie: | There are some things that are in place to try to make it move a little bit better, and that's what we’re talking about today. This is… |
| Ben: | Oh woah... we're talking about 101 traffic? |
| Katie: | Well, not exact… whaaaaa... not literally but almost literally. This... this is in the... in the category of things you never knew there were science behind but there's a lot of science behind them. |
| Ben: | We… I just realized we are still in our intro. So I’ll say, you’re listening to Linear Digression. |
| Ben: | Okay, that was the longest intro we've ever done. |
| Katie: | That’s what happens when I’m in charge of intros. Yeah, we’re talking about traffic ramp metering system. |
| Ben: | Traffic ramp metering… I… every time I go by one of those, I wonder what’s driving it, actually. |
| Katie: | Yeah, we should explain what this is because these... I have learned... I have read a lot about traffic ramp metering. And these are actually pretty regional specific and there are many places even within the United States that don't have these at all. So we should first explain… |
| Ben: | Oh really? |
| Katie: | Oh yeah, they have them in California, they have a lot of them in Illinois, but for example, I grew up in Ohio but I never saw any of them in Ohio, in fact there aren't any in Ohio. So we should explain to all Ohioans out there. |
| Ben: | I don't know you grew up in Ohio. |
| Katie: | You didn’t? |
| Ben: | No, I didn’t. |
| Katie: | Oh yeah, I’m a really proud Buckeye. |
| Ben: | So what is... so... what are… so traffic ramps... on-ramps, you've got a free way, you got to get onto the freeway, so you drive onto the on-ramp onto the freeway. Sometimes when you have particularly busy freeways, especially when they were rush… when there's rush hour traffic, like 101 for example in California, if you just let everybody on whenever they want to go on, then you get these floods of cars… |
| Katie: | And then they come in all the whole freeway. |
| Ben: | Yeah, like these clumps of cars that come in at the same time and then the traffic light... that's... that's further away from the freeway turns red and then no cars go on the freeway and then it turns green and then all the cars on the freeway, so there’re these traffic metering systems, they're just stop lights and they're there to regulate the flow to… to basically to normalize the flow so that way you always have cars coming on at a consistent rate. |
| Katie: | Yeah, and it's a little bit of a paradox but it's well worn-out now both by theory and empirical study that if you control the rate at which people access the highways, then overall this makes the highway less prone to congestion even though it takes a little bit longer for each individual car to get on the highway because there's a light there that they need to wait for. The highway as a whole functions much better and you get where you're going much faster. |
| Ben: | I've got to say because I'm a huge traffic patterns geek, I also have to say that I don't have... I don't think we have an audience big enough to actually make a real impact, but I can say that if you cut people off on the road that will slow down traffic in general, because you end up with ripples that go back from where you cut people off, and in fact if you don't merge nicely like if you wait until the last minute and then kind of like push your way in, that also causes issues. So if you are one of those people who waits till the last minute and just kind of like crams your way in there, it's going to... it's going to slow everyone down. So now I've said my piece, I think I'll get off my soapbox. |
| Katie: | (laughs) Yeah, so this is… this is a topic that a lot have studied, and it is used to be done by both academic institutions and various State Department of Transportations... Department of Transportation, things like that, that studied this, and that have… I remember a number of algorithms that are being used in different places and one of the things that’s really fun about reading the summary intro on this is they tell you about all the different algorithms where you can actually find them implemented. So like… |
| Ben: | Oh really? |
| Katie: | Like oh… SWARM happens outside of Seattle, and then there's this other algorithm called The Helper Ramp Algorithm, I’m probably messing some of these up. But there’re like… that one outside of.. there’s Northern Virginia outside of Washington DC. |
| Ben: | You have occupied so much of my free time just now. I didn't realize that these algorithms were just discoverable, which I guess I should have done more Googling and less thinking on the road but that's… |
| Katie: | Well, it’s okay. I didn't even know there were like algorithms algorithms until somebody mentioned it at the lunch table a couple months ago. And I got very… |
| Ben: | Oh nice, I wanna sit at your lunch table. |
| Katie: | Oh yeah, my lunch table is pretty… there’s a lot going on there. We learned about traffic metering systems.So there’re many of these algorithms. As you can imagine, I think there's a lot of maybe customizing the algorithms to the exact highway that you're on, so something like the 101, where you have a straight shot highway that's basically going between San Francisco and San Jose, it has lots of ons and it has lots of offs, and there are a couple big roads that might have intersected a couple places, I'm thinking about things like the 84, Freeway 1. |
| Ben: | 85 |
| Katie: | 85, thank you. Who’s familiar with the... |
| Ben: | Oh wait, no, 85 and 84. |
| Katie: | No, 85 is for Cupertino. |
| Ben: | 84 is the bridge. |
| Katie: | Yeah. That’s… whatever. |
| Ben: | 85 kind of feeds into it. |
| Katie: | Yeah, and then you have like the 380. So you have some of these big crossroads, but for the most part it's a straight shot. That... that might be a very different algorithm, that you might want to have for a system like that than if you live in Los Angeles, which I have only have to navigate the roads and once or twice, but I remember it was a labyrinth of just checkered pattern, it felt like sometimes where you couldn't go more than 4 miles on a major interstate without hitting another major interstate that was going into different directions. |
| Ben: | So yeah, so that'll... that'll... land itself to a totally different traffic... traffic patterns. |
| Katie: | Yeah, so there’s all these algorithms that are being applied in different places. And it's really fun to read about these and in general they fall into a couple big categories, just to give you an idea of what's going on out there. So first is that… it was what’s called Isolated Algorithms. So this is where you have each meter... is kind of ignoring what's going on with any other meter. So usually you have many different on-ramps that are being metered all within the same general vicinity cuz you're trying to control many points of access potentially the same time. And isolated systems... what's going on... on one on-ramp, is basically completely independent of what's going on in another on-ramp, except there’s so far that there's... there's... this highway between that might be sort of connecting them in a way, but for example, you don't have a situation where an upstream light is trying to... say... hold back some of the cars so say… (inaudible) queue on the downstream ramp can dissipate. |
| Ben: | Right, they're not talking to each other. |
| Katie: | Exactly. |
| Ben: | But there is one huge benefit of having isolated systems, which is that they're cheap. |
| Katie: | True. |
| Ben: | So just build a bunch of these things and you don't have to worry about finding a way for them to talk to each other or maintaining that system. |
| Katie: | Yeah, and we were thinking a little bit about geographical isolation, but there's also some sort of these systems that are sort of temporarily set and then set it and forget it, I guess so… |
| Ben: | So they let a car in every eight seconds or whatever during these hours and that's it. |
| Katie: | Exactly, regardless of what's going on the road, like whether there's construction going on, or there's an accident going on, or whatever they do the same thing. |
| Ben: | You know, that drives me nuts like on Memorial Day or something, where the light doesn't know that it's a holiday and nobody's on the roads and so I still have to wait for it. |
| Katie: | Yeah, so… so... there's this algorithm and then there's the ones that are more dynamically responsive to what the actual conditions on the road are, and they make sort of on the Fly decision, either in an isolated way or in collaboration with the other lights in the network to try to decide... you know, what's the appropriate rate at which I should be metering people onto the this highway. |
| Ben: | Mm hmm. |
| Katie: | You have your isolated systems, we talked about those, and then there's also the coordinated system, so this is where the different ramps are talking to each other so to speak. And these fall under a few big categories. There's Cooperative Algorithms, which is where all of the ramps are trying to distribute load among themselves if there's a… say, a big back up at one of the ramps then maybe one of the other ramps will hold back a little ways so that... that backup has a chance to sort of work its way out of its own. |
| Ben: | Oh, they sound so friendly to each other. |
| Katie: | Yeah, and then there's Competitive, which is where there's... there's... so there's always kind of an inherent tension in these systems just to back up for a second, which is that you have the local traffic... you don't want to have the light always be red because then you're going to have these local backups on all the surface streets cause no one's getting on the highway. And you don't want to have the light be always green because then what's the point of having a light? So there's always kind of this tension between letting lots of cars onto the highway and holding them back, because somewhere you know, that the system has to deal with the fact that there's lots of cars that want to get through it, and it's just like how do you deal with the local versus the highway congestion, you know, who has to bear the weight of that congestion I guess, is what I'm saying, the surface streets or the... or the highway. And so the Competitive Algorithms are a little bit based on the idea of balancing between those two systems that there might be pressure from the surface streets that there's a big queue that says let cars on, let cars on, let cars on, but there might also be sort of a backup on the highway which says don't give me anymore don't give me anymore, and then the competitive algorithms have to sort of compete these two scenarios against each other and then pick the one that in general with a pick is the one that's more restrictive and any given ramp, and so this includes the compass algorithm, the bottleneck algorithm and SWARM, which is an awesome name for an algorithm. You can read about all of these, cuz they each have specific different ways that they will distribute the load amongst the various ramps or the ways that they make their decisions or whatever. And then the third one is called Integral Algorithms. Integral Ramp Algorithms have something that reminds me a little bit of maybe something like reinforcement learning if people are familiar with that. So you have this objective function and it'll be something like how... how many cars are being allowed to move through a certain area at a certain time, or how quickly does it take to get from a certain reference point to another reference point. And you say that we want there to be a maximal reasonably within some reasonable bounds... this is the maximum number of cars that we think should be going through. or this is the fastest speed at which we think realistically cars should be going through. And then it's going to try to find parameters for all the different ramps that will optimize that objective function, so sometimes it might have the ramps turning on, sometimes it has them turning off, but it's not thinking about it in terms of how long am I waiting in line for the light to change versus how fast am I moving when I get on the highway. It is thinking about from the time I say... leave the parking lot of my job to the time I get home, you know, adding up all of the different places where I would have to wait together and then trying to come up with something that optimizes for all of it at the same time. That's a little bit of the... the philosophy behind the Integral Metering Algorithms. And so you can see these are each very different ways of thinking about the problem which is one of the things that I think makes it so cool is that there's all these different ways that people have found to solve this problem, and they are being used in all of these different systems and you can go through and you can read about what they're doing in Seattle and what they're doing in... in San Jose and San Francisco, and what are they doing in in Washington or in Chicago, and it's different for every one of them, and so that's something that I think was really really fun about this is that there's lots of different sophisticated... sophisticated people who were thinking about this... sophisticated programs that they used to do the simulations to try to make sure that the algorithms actually work that they're not creating huge problems. But that there's so many different answers the people manage to come up with. |
| Ben: | Mm… I have a couple thoughts, which are one and a way a traffic engineer, if they're doing their job perfectly, they are never noticed. Right? There’re a lot of jobs like that, like a sound engineer at a live concert. If they do their job well, they're never noticed and no one says thank you. So if you're listening and you are a traffic engineers, huge thanks to you for all of the fairly selfless feeling work that you do to save everyone minutes and... and optimize people’s day, and I guess in a way. The second thing I want to say is when you mentioned… the I-380, I was like... I don't know that road, maybe Katie got confused and I searched Wikipedia and I found it and I was just being stupid, I forgot about it. But it turns out Wikipedia has a ton of really interesting information... information about all of these different highways. It never occurred to me to read the Wikipedia articles for the roads that I travel on. But... |
| Katie: | That’s never occurred to me either, actually. I think I'm going to go down the rabbit hole tonight. |
| Ben: | Yeah, apparently 380 was going to go all the way to the coast to Highway 1 but that would go over the San Andreas Fault and so they didn't tackle that project. |
| Katie: | Oh, that’s… I can see why that might be a good idea then to not build a major highway going over to San Andreas Fault. |
| Ben: | I'm so glad I don't build bridges for a living, like just think about the... you better do your job, right? And then the other thing I wanted to just share is... if you have, I guess it’s especially when you have kids, one fun thing to do is to pay attention to the traffic patterns and stop lights, and you can usually figure out like if you're at a left hand turn and you can usually figure out by looking at the other lights when your light is going to change. And so if you’re... if you’re with a kid or if you're with someone who doesn't... who hasn't figured that out... right before the light is about to change, just look at it and then (mimicking wind blowing sound) blow, and then the light changes, and then they will think you are a wizard. They’ll be like oh my God, that is magical! |
| Katie: | When I lived in Switzerland, one of the things they do in Switzerland I thought this was so brilliant, I don't know why we don't do this, is so … in the United States, we’ll be looking at the screen for a while, then I'll be yelling at at it for a few seconds and then red and then it turns green again. |
| Ben: | Right. |
| Katie: | But in Switzerland, and in France too I think. |
| Ben: | A lot of Europe, it turns yellow right? |
| Katie: | Yeah, it turns yellow between red and green and so you always have... like a couple seconds warning, that it's about to turn green, which is kind of nice, because everyone in Europe drive stick shift, they don't drive automatic cars, so you really want to have a couple seconds to get your car in gear and then when it actually turns green then that's when your car starts moving but it took you a little while to get it there anyway. I just thought that was so clever. |
| Ben: | Just in general... traveling in Europe, the infrastructure for trains, buses, bicycles, especially like I'm thinking of Amsterdam, it's just phenomenal, it's really cool. |
| Katie: | Are you just talking that traffic circles? Is that really what you mean when you say phenomenal? |
| Ben: | No, it's not traffic circles. They have six different modalities of transporting yourself in Amsterdam and... it's just amazing how smoothly everything runs, you know, like, and how well signed at least in my experience... as a foreigner, how well signed everything is and how it's surprisingly easy to not die despite how it looks like you would just die if you try to ride a bike on those roads or something. |
| Katie: | And fun fact, Netherlands has the same algorithm that they run in Seattle. So if you happen to live in Seattle, you're getting a little taste of that traffic control, it’s called the Fuzzy Logic Algorithm.
