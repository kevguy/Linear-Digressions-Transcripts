| Ben: | Hey Katie. |
| Katie: | Hi Ben. |
| Ben: | So I have a problem and maybe I'll just try and explain it to you and see if you can help me. Basically I'm just not really sure what type of episode you want to cover today, I don’t really have any information on what kinds of things you might want to talk about, any ideas on how we can address that? |
Katie: |
Ben, this is one of your weaker moments of dialog here. I feel like usually once we get into the middle of the episode we usually have a pretty good clip. |
| Ben: | Mm… yeah! |
| Katie: | But the beginnings are tough, aren't they? |
Ben: |
Ben: Yeah, I kind of feel like this is a cold start or something. Okay, so this is a joke between Katie and I, you will understand it by the end of the episode. You’re listening to Linear Digressions. |
Ben: |
Ben: Okay, so fundamentally what this episode is about is a recommendation engine, and we've talked about it in the past, but specifically we're going to talk about a problem called the Cold Start Problem. |
| Katie: | Indeed, indeed. We should probably start by recapping recommendation engines real quick. Definitely. |
| Ben: | Yes. |
| Ben: | Let’s use Netflix as the example here. |
| Katie: | I love Netflix, yeah, let’s use Netflix. So the idea of Netflix is you can watch movies on the internet, and for those of you who are not familiar with Netflix, one of the things that really characterizes the Netflix experience if you will, is that you have sort of this account, you log in and it will give you... you can search for movies but the main way that people usually end up watching things is because Netflix will recommend thanks to you and it will say something like people who like this movie also like blah blah blah. |
| Ben: | Yeah, exactly, so look at your watching habits and look at the watching habits or viewing habits of all the other people in the service and it'll say like ‘hey, you kind of seem similar to this person and this person and this person and these people have watched this movie, and you have not, so maybe you might like it’. |
| Katie: | Yeah, and so these algorithms are called Collaborative Filtering, and so the idea is that you have lots of and lots of movies and you have lots and lots of people and so... like you said, you can start to look for users who are similar, and often there will be some kind of also like eat-and-treats that they're looking for, it'll say something like ‘oh, it looks like you like westerns and we know that’ something like that. But... that's... that's getting a little bit… |
| Ben: | Also, I have to say these work really really really well. Because a lot of times and Netflix will know what I want to watch better than I know what I want to watch. |
| Katie: | Oh yeah, and I sometimes get the thing where I log in and it says ‘would you like to watch this movie’ and I kind of think ‘I forgot about that, but yeah I really want to watch that movie’. |
| Ben: | I do, I do wanna watch it yeah. |
| Katie: | Yeah, they actually can be quite good and I think I read somewhere that something like 75% of the watching the people do on Netflix is because it recommends them, maybe there’s even more at this point. But, there's some places where these collaborative filtering algorithms have a little bit of trouble, and the one of them in particular is what's called ‘The Cold Start Problem’. |
| Ben: | Mm hmm. |
| Katie: | And what the problem is is even communicated a little bit in the name, so the idea is you and I both have... well actually... better point... So you have a Netflix account, I technically don't, I use my husband’s login... |
| Ben: | Oh really? Oh nice, okay. |
| Katie: | Yes, so like I basically do. But let’s say I were to open an account with Netflix tomorrow, they don't actually know where it... well maybe they could do some kind of something with the IP address or something, but let’s assume that they don’t know who I am. |
| Ben: | You’re are total (inaudible) blank slate user they know nothing about you other than... maybe information that you give them when they... when you login like your gender and maybe your age, I'm not sure what they ask for, and then they also know like very very loosely some kind of geographic location, so don't know that you're you're in Chicago as opposed to like Berlin or wherever. |
| Katie: | Right, and so I walk in the door, I gave them almost no information, let's say I gave them no information, and I say ‘Entertain Me’. |
| Ben: | Right, they’re expected to know what would entertain you and they're expected to present some options to you and be reasonably good. And this... this is actually the problem that occurs all over the place, pretty much anytime you have a new user to any system, and that system is known for providing recommendations, that's when you run into this problem. |
| Katie: | Yes, and so just to be totally clear, the problem is that normally the way that these engines work is it looks like... it looks at what I've done in the past and implicitly, you know, what are the movies that I've watched, what rating that I give them, and then compare that to the... the body of all the users, but if I have no past then I have no record, and I can be used to match me against other people in the... in the service, and so where is it supposed to place for me, like it's kind of blind. |
| Ben: | So how do you actually adapt to that? Cause I mean if you have very little data, or no data, I mean, what is there really to do? |
| Katie: | Right, so that is a very good question. And I was reading a very good paper about this that we will post and… oh, and our new website, we have a website, folks. |
| Ben: | We have a new website. |
| Katie: | Should we go on a very brief digression about the new website, I don’t know, there isn’t very much to say, but nah. |
| Ben: | Well, I mean, all the thanks goes to you because you... you... you did all of the work with the exception of transferring the domain, and I'm a web developer, so I should know how to do this. But it's just every single time I have to do that it's such a painful awful process to do domain transfer stuff, and then there's caching issues, so like the website will be down for certain people but only with if there were certain ISPs and other ISPs internet service providers like Comcast would be fine, it's just... it's just a whole massive gross awfulness that can only be... like you couldn't dream up that kind of complexity, and the only way you can find that kind of complexity is by building a system piece by piece over the course of decades, and then you end up with all of this nastiness. |
| Katie: | That was so much more pontification than I was expecting, I had no idea you felt so strongly about these things. |
| Ben: | I just feel like the world of web development has been consistently getting better with the exception of perhaps... perhaps the sole exception of domains, domain names, all that stuff. And actually if you'll permit me one other brief rant… |
| Katie: | Oh, by all means. |
| Ben: | If, I actually... if you're a listener and you own a domain name, let's say you bought this six to nine months ago, and you bought it for a year, mydomainname.com, or something, which is probably taken. But, and then you get an email, you get in the mail, you get this thing that says ‘hey, your domain is going to expire in 3 months, you can renew here, and you get a discount, it’s only $45.’ Well, you might... you might remember when you bought the domain, it was only $10, but you might not. What's actually happening is that who this information associated with the domain, some other really evil company, is taking that information, email or mail you something saying ‘hey, you own a domain with us’. And then they get you to transfer it to them and get you to pay them 4 times as much money. |
| Katie: | Yuck. |
| Ben: | So domain sucks. That's... that's all I gotta say about that. |
| Katie: | While you were doing that, mydomainname.com with two n's in the middle is not taken, if you only want one n in the middle, it looks like that is. |
| Ben: | Yes. |
| Katie: | And no, they're not doing anything with it. Anywho, another domain name you cannot get, because we have it, is linear-digressions.com. |
| Ben: | Alright. |
| Katie: | We invite you to come check it out if you like. The main draw would be because when we talk about papers and blog posts and things like this, open source repos, what-have-you, we like to post links to these, so those will be... we’ll be putting them in the show notes, but I get it, it's like the world's worst way of disseminating that information. So come to the website and there will just be a link there and... and it has all the archives, and so you can go back in time and if there's a particular episode from the past and you want to go find a paper, knock yourself out. And if you happen to find any lines that are broken or anything like that, we... I think they're all good, but feel free to reach out, and just let me know cuz you know... quality controls are tricky, anyway. |
| Ben: | Also, the visual nature of the website has changed, it’s a bit more plain now, that’s not really a concern for either of us even though I’m a web developer, just because right now we're actually using Squarespace on all places, within this is not an ad for Squarespace, I’m sure WIC or whatever, all their competitors are... would be just as... just as fine, but the goal was of course to get all of this information in a really easy-to-put-up-on-the-web way. So there we have it. |
| Katie: | Yep, Squarespace is not paying us but it’s pretty easy to use. |
| Ben: | Yeah, let’s rewind a little bit to those engines and how do you deal with the cold start problem. |
| Katie: | Yes, so… the paper that I had fun flipping through when thinking about this is called ‘Methods and Metrics for Cold Start Recommendations’, it's just a little 6 pager, it's actually pretty readable. And so it spent half of the paper just sort of explaining the setup, but then in maybe the second half or so of the paper they're looking at a couple of different methods that you can use to... to try to resolve this. So one of the ways that they talk about... there’re a couple different algorithms that they look at, they call them... there's like a Naive Bayes based algorithm and there's some expectation explanation algorithm but basically they're based on the idea that... I should have mentioned it at the beginning, sort of by accident and then steer the conversation away, the idea of latent traits, that maybe you like certain genres of movies or maybe you'd like certain actors or something like this, this is a little bit... yeah, this is a little bit more for the case, not necessarily of a new user, we'll come back to that in a second, but let’s say there’s a new movie that Netflix has a list and they have to figure out who to recommend to. |
| Ben: | Interesting, so rather than just new users, this problem exists whenever you put really any new thing that's involved in predictions, so in Netflix you got the new user problem, you also got the ‘hey we have a new movie’ problem. We don't know... of our entire user base, we don't know who likes this movie, and so we can maybe guess that like based on certain... certain things like the genre or the actors who are in it, we can guess that it's similar to these movies which these users like, so maybe these other users would like it yardi yardi yarda but… |
| Katie: | Yeah, so you use some of the content attributes of the movie, so that means that you have to have a little bit more data that you carry around you... you would have to keep track of something like the actors, or the genre or maybe like where it was made, those sorts of things, and in general content-based recommendations don't usually seem to work quite as well as collaborative filtering, they're certainly... at large-scale they don't work as well as collaborative filtering, but when you're trying to get started, it's... it's a place where you can or you can get some very quick games just because... like I said, you... you don't have to know what other people were thinking of this movie, you just have to know some of the attributes of the movie and I can give you a place to start guessing. And then the second thing that I was thinking about is they have some slightly more sophisticated algorithms for how to deal with the cold start problem for people, but some pretty reasonable stuff that you could do for people is you just recommend... you look at the aggregated movies that seem to be doing well for the population as a whole, and you recommend those, you just basically just recommend the popular movies. And that gets you out of sort of this little trough at the beginning, and it's... I'm a little bit getting myself like getting myself like… thinking myself in circles here a little bit, cuz there a few different problems that they're trying to solve on this paper, one of them is ‘who should we make recommendations to’, the second one is if we make a recommendation, will this person rate this thing highly, like will they give it four, five stars or something, and those can be slightly different problems in terms of how you approach them. Based on the problem also, there might be some peculiarities and exactly what the... what you're going to sorta optimized for, when you're trying to solve it, so they point out that for a lot of recommendation engine problems, you want to minimize the number of false positives, so you want to minimize the number of times that you recommend something to someone, and they end up really not liking it, cuz then they tend to lose confidence in your service, and that might be more expensive to you in the long run than if you thought of me something on the table so to speak, for something that they could like but you don't recommend it to them, cuz you aren't... you aren’t 100% sure that that might be less... a less bad outcome to you than asking them to watch something and they end up really not liking. So for each of these different scenarios, there's different ways that you can jump start your recommendation engine, and there's also different standards that you're going to hold yourself to, because depending on exactly what the scenario is, you might want it to say for certain kinds of mistakes over other kinds of mistakes. But one of the points that they make at the end which I thought was kind of well considered is that… you know, they have some of these kind of sophisticated latent trait models with expectation maximization and naive Bayes in this point is... it's like kind of complicated and sound scientific, and then they compared them to very simple heuristics like recommends popular movies, or if you have to guess what what rating a user is going to give a movie, guess their average rating over all the movies that they ever watched, let’s say this person usually gives fours, just guess a four, I don’t know. |
| Ben: | Mm hmm. |
| Katie: | And they find that even though heuristic algorithms often tend to do fairly well, and their point in saying this, is that you can do something fancy and it might do well, but if you do something very simple that might do well too, and so, this is a case where... as you're... you know, say you're doing a literature review or something, I’m trying to... what are all the different ways you can solve this problem, they point out that just because something does well doesn't mean that it's a particularly smart algorithm, it seems like it's actually just pretty easy to make some con… excuse me, it seems like it's just pretty easy to make some progress fairly quickly on this, as it happens, so you want to have that piece of context when you're interpreting anybody else... anybody claims about how great their algorithm is.
