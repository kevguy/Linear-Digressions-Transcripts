| Katie: | Hey everybody, we’ve gone indie. |
| Ben: | Yeah, what does that mean? Well, we’re now an independent podcast. We are no longer being produced out of the offices of Udacity. A couple things have changed. For one, we’re actually… now we know how to use Twitter. So you can find us on twitter@lindigressions, that l-i-n-digressons. And you can also find us on SoundCloud at soundcloud.com/lineardigressions. If you go to lineardigressions.com, you’ll find all of that information, the links… and all that stuff. We also want to say thank you serious… thank you to all of the people at Udacity who have helped inspire us with podcast ideas, talked with us on the show, and to help us get off the ground. So, thank you to all those people and yeah, all the best to them. |
| Katie: | I have also joined Twitter, it took like 6 years but I’m on Twitter now. |
| Ben: | Oh, you have a Twitter account? |
| Katie: | I do, yeah. I’m… we shoulda explain the provenance of my Twitter handle in some future episode but I am at multiarmedbandit. So… |
| Ben: | Multiarmbandit? I'm going to follow you right now, and I am of course at benjaffe, which is my name, J-A-F-F-E. Thanks for listening, and we’ll see you next week. |
