| Ben: | This is Linear Digression. |
| Katie: | So Ben, I have a joke for you. You ready? |
| Ben: | I am ready. |
| Katie: | Okay, you're gonna like this. I like my coffee like I like my war. Cold. |
| Ben: | Wh... |
| Katie: | You're not, you're not laughing, are you? |
| Ben: | Wh...What is that? |
| Katie: | So it's a...it's joke. So maybe you've heard a joke like this. That was just an example of one. |
| Ben: | I get it, but it's not funny. |
| Katie: | It's a little. It's funny. |
| Ben: | It's a little, it's funny because it's just weird. |
| Katie: | It's a little, it's a little bit off kilter. But well, it turns out that was not written by human. As it turns out, so that's what we're talking about in our episode today. |
| Ben: | Of course, we're into machine learning, it wouldn't be written by a human. |
| Katie: | Naturally. |
| Ben: | Written by a cyborg or... |
| Katie: | I'll just, it would be difficult er... [inaudible] closer than you might guess, yeah. |
| Ben: | Okay. |
| Katie: | Written by a computer. |
| Ben: | So...wh...what? |
| Katie: | Yeah! |
| Ben: | I don't even have words. Wait, so you're telling me that computers are starting to write jokes now? Because humans are not good enough for it(?)? Or... |
| Katie: | Oh... |
| Ben: | We need more jokes? |
| Katie: | We always need more jokes, don't we? |
| Ben: | Alright, I guess so. |
| Katie: | Mm...I mean, yeah! It's a project that I think honestly somebody just picked up cause he thought it sounded funny, and I can totally appreciate that. But also because humor is one of those things that's classifically very difficult to do computationally. It's hard to, like, tell a computer what 'funny' is. And so this was an attempt to actually use a machine learning, a clustering machine algorithm, to write jokes and to see if a computer can be funny. |
| Ben: | And what was the outcome? That joke? |
| Katie: | That joke was literally written by computer. Yes. |
| Ben: | You know (what), it's growing on me. |
| Katie: | It's a... I like it. |
| Ben: | It's... I like my war cold. It's just weird. |
| Katie: | Well, I mean, a computer doesn't know anything about the cold coffee or the cold war. |
| Ben: | So how does it work then? |
| Katie: | So what happens is the jokes that were generated by this particular algorithm... there was a clustering algorithm that was designed to write jokes in that sort of formula: I like my X like I like my Y. Z. |
| Ben: | Okay! I got it. |
| Katie: | Yeah. So within those constraints there're a few rules. And it's that X and Y are both nouns. So in this exmaple, what was it? |
| Ben: | Coffee and war. |
| Katie: | Coffee and war. And then cold is an adjective that describes both of those very commonly but you don't usually get those two nouns, like in word, in a sentence together. And so there's sorta this like... this instance there that's then funny. |
| Ben: | I see. So this instance bacause you don't have many sentences that mentions both coffee and war. |
| Katie: | Right. |
| Ben: | And the connection being that you often see cold coffee and you see cold war next to each other. |
| Katie: | Yeah. I think especially they look for instances where the adjective sorta means different senses in the two...sort of tuplets. So the cold war was not literally a war, it was of cold temperature, right? |
| Ben: | Well, in some ways. |
| Katie: | It was sort of (related to) Russia I guess. |
| Ben: | The computer probably doesn't know that. |
| Katie: | No, the computer totally doesn't know that. But the idea is you can sort of start to nail down what makes one of these jokes funny, and then you send the computer out to like a huge corpus of text, that has lots and lots of words, and then it looks for examples of like two nouns and an adjective that fit into this pattern. And then if it finds them, ba-dum ching, you have your joke. |
| Ben: | I see. So is any of it part of this machine learning? Or is it just a algorithm that's just running through and running though and running through? Like the joke improves in some way or... |
| Katie: | So I think, to answer your first question: how is this machine learning? The only way that you can have a computer write joke... you can't give the computer a set of rules for what's funny cause it's a computer. What you have to do is give it some constraints and then like lots of examples. And it finds... it finds it so. |
| Ben: | Got it. |
| Katie: | And that's where machine learning comes in. It's not machine learning in the most classical sense. So usually with machine learning we can go with regression, or supervised classifier... whatever. Obviously, you have to write a sort of custom built algorithm for this particular task. |
| Ben: | Mmhmm. |
| Katie: | And so the results are that it's sort of funny. (Laughs) |
| Ben: | Yeah. |
| Katie: | As you diagnosed at the beginning. They have a few examples of different types of jokes, so which may keep you chuckle a little bit. but they do mention in the article that it sounds like basically the people who wrote this and took the jokes sort of walk around their buddies' offices and asked if they thought it was funny or not. And that, generally the computer... they said like sixteen percent of the computer-generated jokes are funny, maybe one in six. The human-generated jokes is more like one in three. So we're still being supreme. |
| Ben: | Alright. Good. |
| Katie: | Yeah, I know, right? |
| Ben: | Good. This is the only kind of joke that this particular algorithm can make? |
| Katie: | Totally. Yeah. |
| Ben: | But this algorthm doesn't know knock-knock jokes? |
| Katie: | No. |
| Ben: | For example, or any of that? Oh, I mean the knock-knock jokes aren't funny though. They are funny is not the jokes I know or the ones that are making fun of the knock-knock joke, which is a whole other... |
| Katie: | [inaudible] very meta knock-knock joke generator, just like that. |
| Ben: | Oh... I guess you could. So...no humor is necessarily outside the range of machine learning? |
| Katie: | Oh. |
| Ben: | Or somewhat difficult? Or... |
| Katie: | I generally say that the subtler or the more unique the humor, like a really good standup comedian would probably be pretty hard to generate. But obviously, you have something that's kind of formulated like this, and this particularly like text-based, you could come up with like examples of three words that satisfy this pattern. And like, yeah, sometimes you can come up with something pretty funny. |
| Ben: | Got it. So slams and comedies are still safe right now. |
| Katie: | I hope so, yeah. But someday, if it figures out how a computer generated Three Stooges then yeah, we might as well just all go home. |
| Ben: | We might as well just... we give up. So, can you maybe give me two more examples? |
| Katie: | I can. I can. So here... I give you my secdonary one: I like my boys like my sectors. Bad. |
| Ben: | Oh no, it's a harddrive joke. |
| Katie: | This one you have to explain to me. I didnt' get it the first time around. But...yeah. |
| Ben: | A bad sector is an area on your disk that's gone bad for some reason. And it's no longer readable. Or it's corrupted, or something like that. And so... yeah, I don't know. It's pretty good. |
| Katie: | So it doesn't... so it's not bad in the same sense that, there's like bad boys. |
| Ben: | No. |
| Katie: | It's literally just... |
| Ben: | It's a hundred percent different. |
| Katie: | You know it's a good joke if someone has to explain it to you. But I'm glad you explained that to me. It's funnier now. |
| Ben: | Yeah, it seems like the audience is a little bit smaller for that one. |
| Katie: | Mmhmm. Clearly. |
| Ben: | Only people know about bad sectors. So what's your last one? |
| Katie: | Okay. Another computer-based one: I like my relationship like my source. Open. |
| Ben: | Oh boy. Those are... |
| Katie: | Get it? Open relatipnship? Open source? Hey. |
| Ben: | I get it. I get it. Yeah. I'm still not laughing. But... |
| Katie: | But you are... for those of you at home who can't see it, he is, he is literally smiling right now. |
| Ben: | I am smiling. It's a very stoic smile. |
| Katie: | Ha ha. |
| Ben: | No. No. That's pretty good. Nice, I like it. So theoretically, you could just run this through any text and look for associations of any of this stuff, so you could like, obviously, the corpus for this was very computer related or at least it's partially computer related. |
| Katie: | Yes. |
| Ben: | Cause open source's in it and there's bad sector. |
| Katie: | Mmhmm. |
| Ben: | And I don't know, cold coffee might be related to... |
| Katie: | That's a good point. I hadn't thought about that. |
| Ben: | Programmers? |
| Katie: | Yeah. This is something that are... This is generally true in machine learning: the bigger the dataset that you have to run over, the generally better results you'll get. So, I don't know if this could work, if you only have a, you know, a really small, like a single newspaper article or something like that. But yeah, there's an entire Internet out there, so... |
| Ben: | Open call to anyone who wants to do this, meaning, please please do this. Can you do this with all of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books? I would love a whole set of Harry-Potter-themed jokes. |
| Katie: | That's a good, that's a good podcast idea for another one. There's an application of machine learning for specifically that involves J.K. Rowling. But we'll look into that maybe another day. |
| Ben: | Yeah, that sounds good. |
| Katie: | Okay. |
